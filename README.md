FElupe is a Python 3.6+ finite element analysis package focussing on the formulation and numerical solution of nonlinear problems in continuum mechanics of solid bodies. Its name is a combination of FE (finite element) and the german word *Lupe* (magnifying glass) as a synonym for getting a little insight how a finite element analysis code looks like under the hood.

# Installation
Install Python, fire up a terminal and run

```shell
pip install felupe[all]
```

where `[all]` installs all optional dependencies. By default, FElupe does not require `numba` and `sparse`. In order to make use of all features of FElupe, it is suggested to install all optional dependencies. After installation, import FElupe as follows in your script.

```python
import felupe as fe
```

# Changelog
All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file. The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/), and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

## [1.0.0] - 2021-10-19

### Added
- Start using a Changelog.
- Added docstrings for essential classes, methods and functions.
- Add array with point locations for all elements.

### Changed
- Rename element methods (from `basis` to `function` and from `basisprime` to `gradient`).
- Make constitutive materials more flexible (allow material parameters to be passed at stress and elasticity evaluation `umat.gradient(F, mu=1.0)`).
- Rename `ndim` to `dim`.
- Simplify element base classes.
- Speed-up calculation of indices (rows, cols) for Fields and Forms (about 10x faster now).
- Update `test_element.py` according to changes in element methods.

### Removed
- Automatic check if the gradient of a region can be calculated based on the dimensions. The `grad` argument in `region(grad=False)` has to be enforced by the user.

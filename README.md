FElupe is a Python 3.7+ finite element analysis package focussing on the formulation and numerical solution of nonlinear problems in continuum mechanics of solid bodies. Its name is a combination of FE (finite element) and the german word *Lupe* (magnifying glass) as a synonym for getting an insight how a finite element analysis code looks like under the hood.

# Installation
Install Python, fire up a terminal and run

```shell
pip install felupe[all]
```

where `[all]` installs all optional dependencies. By default, FElupe depends on `numpy`, `scipy` and `einsumt`. In order to make use of all features of FElupe, it is suggested to install all optional dependencies (`h5py`, `meshio` and `tensortrax`).

# Getting Started
A quarter model of a solid cube with hyperelastic material behaviour is subjected to a uniaxial elongation applied at a clamped end-face. This involves the creation of a mesh, a region as well as a displacement field (encapsulated in a field container). Furthermore, the boundary conditions are created by a template for a uniaxial loadcase. An isotropic pseudo-elastic Ogden-Roxburgh Mullins-softening model formulation in combination with an isotropic hyperelastic Neo-Hookean material formulation is applied on a nearly-incompressible solid body. A step generates the consecutive substep-movements of a given boundary condition. The step is further added to a list of steps of a job (here, a characteristic-curve job is used). During evaluation, each substep of each step is solved by an iterative Newton-Rhapson procedure. The solution is exported after each completed substep as a time-series XDMF file. For more details beside this high-level code snippet, please have a look at the [documentation](https://felupe.readthedocs.io/en/latest/?badge=latest).

```python
import felupe as fem

# create a hexahedron-region on a cube
mesh = fem.Cube(n=11)
region = fem.RegionHexahedron(mesh)

# add a field container (with a vector-valued displacement field)
field = fem.FieldContainer([fem.Field(region, dim=3)])

# apply a uniaxial elongation on the cube
boundaries = fem.dof.uniaxial(field, clamped=True)[0]

# define the constitutive material behaviour
# and create a nearly-incompressible (u,p,J - formulation) solid body
umat = fem.OgdenRoxburgh(material=fem.NeoHooke(mu=1), r=3, m=1, beta=0)
solid = fem.SolidBodyNearlyIncompressible(umat, field, bulk=5000)

# prepare a step with substeps
move = fem.math.linsteps([0, 2, 0], num=10)
step = fem.Step(items=[solid], ramp={boundaries["move"]: move}, boundaries=boundaries)

# add the step to a job, evaluate all substeps and create a plot
job = fem.CharacteristicCurve(steps=[step], boundary=boundaries["move"])
job.evaluate(filename="result.xdmf")
fig, ax = job.plot(
    xlabel="Displacement $u$ in mm $\longrightarrow$",
    ylabel="Normal Force $F$ in N $\longrightarrow$",
)
```

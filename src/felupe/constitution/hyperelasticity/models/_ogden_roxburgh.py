    r"""`Ogden-Roxburgh <https://doi.org/10.1098%2Frspa.1999.0431>`_ Pseudo-Elastic
    material formulation for an isotropic treatment of the load-history dependent
    Mullins-softening of rubber-like materials.

    Parameters
    ----------
    C : tensortrax.Tensor
        Right Cauchy-Green deformation tensor.
    Wmax_n : ndarray
        State variable: value of the maximum strain energy density in load-history from
        the previous solution.
    material : callable
        Isotropic strain-energy density function. Optional keyword arguments are passed
        to :func:`material <material(C, **kwargs)>`.
    r : float
        Reciprocal value of the maximum relative amount of softening. i.e. ``r=3`` means
        the shear modulus of the base material scales down from :math:`1` (no softening)
        to :math:`1 - 1/3 = 2/3` (maximum softening).
    m : float
        The initial Mullins softening modulus.
    beta : float
        Maximum deformation-dependent part of the Mullins softening modulus.
    **kwargs : dict
        Optional keyword arguments are passed to the isotropic strain energy density
        function :func:`material <material(C, **kwargs)>`.

    Notes
    -----
    The pseudo-elastic strain energy density function :math:`\widetilde{\psi}` and the
    Mullins-effect related evolution equation are given in Eq. :eq:`psi-ogden-roxburgh`.
    The variation of the functional :math:`\phi` is defined in such a way that the term
    :math:`\delta \eta \ \hat{\psi}` is canceled in the variation of the strain energy
    function:math:`\delta \psi`. The evolution equation`:math:`\eta` acts as a
    deformation and deformation-history dependent scaling factor on the variation of the
    distortional part of the strain energy density function.

    ..  math::
        :label: psi-ogden-roxburgh

        \widetilde{\psi} &= \eta \hat{\psi} + \phi

        \eta(\hat{\psi}, \hat{\psi}_\text{max}) &= 1 - \frac{1}{r} \text{erf} \left(
            \frac{\hat{\psi}_\text{max} - \psi}{m + \beta~\hat{\psi}_\text{max}}
        \right)

        \delta \widetilde{\psi} &= -\delta \eta \ \hat{\psi}

        \delta \widetilde{\psi} &= \eta \ \delta \hat{\psi}

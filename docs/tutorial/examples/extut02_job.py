.. topic:: Learn how to apply boundary conditions in a ramped manner within a **Step**
   and run a **Job**.

   * create a **Step** with ramped boundary conditions
    
   * run a **Job** and export a XDMF time-series file

This tutorial once again covers the essential high-level parts of creating and solving
problems with FElupe. This time, however, the external displacements are applied in a
ramped manner. The prescribed displacements of a cube under non-homogenous
:func:`uniaxial loading <felupe.dof.uniaxial>` will be controlled within a
:class:`step <felupe.Step>`. The
:class:`Ogden-Roxburgh <felupe.OgdenRoxburgh>` pseudo-elastic Mullins softening model is
combined with an isotropic hyperelastic :class:`Neo-Hookean <felupe.NeoHooke>` material
formulation, which is further applied on a
:class:`nearly incompressible solid body <felupe.SolidBodyNearlyIncompressible>` for a
realistic analysis of rubber-like materials. Note that the bulk modulus is now an
argument of the (nearly) incompressible solid body instead of the constitutive
Neo-Hookean material definition.

    """Convert a mesh to a given order. Only conversions to ``order=0`` and ``order=2``
    are supported. This function supports meshes with cell types ``"triangle"``,
    ``"tetra"``, ``"quad"`` and ``"hexahedron"``.

    Parameters
    ----------
    points : list or ndarray
        Original point coordinates.
    cells : list or ndarray
        Original point-connectivity of cells.
    cell_type : str
        A string in VTK-convention that specifies the cell type. Must be one of
        ``"triangle"``, ``"tetra"``, ``"quad"`` or ``"hexahedron"``.
    order : int, optional
        The order of the converted mesh (default is 0). If 0, the points-array will be
        of shape ``(ncells, dim)``. If 0 and ``calc_points`` is True, the mean of all
        points per cell is evaluated. If 0 and ``calc_points`` is False, the points
        array is filled with zeros. If 2, at least midpoints on cell edges are added to
        the mesh. If 2 and ``calc_midfaces`` is True, midpoints on cell faces are also
        added. If 2 and ``calc_midvolumes`` is True, midpoints on cell volumes are also
        added. Raises an error if not 0 or 2.
    calc_points : bool, optional
        Flag to return the mean of all points per cell if ``order=0`` (default is
        False). If False, the points-array is filled with zeros.
    calc_midfaces : bool, optional
        Flag to add midpoints on cell faces if ``order=2`` (default is False).
    calc_midvolumes : bool, optional
        Flag to add midpoints on cell volumes if ``order=2`` (default is False).

    Returns
    -------
    points : ndarray
        Modified point coordinates.
    cells : list or ndarray
        Converted cells.
    cell_type : str or None
        A string in VTK-convention that specifies the cell type.

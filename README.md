FElupe is a Python 3.6+ finite element analysis package focussing on the formulation and numerical solution of nonlinear problems in continuum mechanics of solid bodies. Its name is a combination of FE (finite element) and the german word *Lupe* (magnifying glass) as a synonym for getting a little insight how a finite element analysis code looks like under the hood.

# Installation
Install Python, fire up a terminal and run

```shell
pip install felupe[all]
```

where `[all]` installs all optional dependencies. By default, FElupe does not require `numba` and `sparse`. In order to make use of all features of FElupe, it is suggested to install all optional dependencies.

# Hello, FElupe!
A quarter model of a solid cube with hyperelastic material behavior is subjected to a uniaxial elongation applied at a clamped end-face. This involves the creation of a mesh, a region and a displacement field. Furthermore, the boundary conditions are created by a template for a uniaxial loadcase. The material behavior is defined through a FElupe-built-in Neo-Hookean material formulation. Inside a Newton-Rhapson procedure, the internal force vector and the tangent stiffness matrix are generated by assembling both linear and bilinear forms of static equilibrium. Finally, the solution of the incremental displacements is calculated und updated until convergence is reached. For more details beside this high-level code snippet, please have a look at the [documentation](https://felupe.readthedocs.io/en/latest/?badge=latest).

```python
import felupe as fe

# create a hexahedron-region on a cube
region = fe.RegionHexahedron(fe.Cube(n=11))

# add a displacement field and apply a uniaxial elongation on the cube
displacement = fe.Field(region, dim=3)
boundaries, dof0, dof1, ext0 = fe.dof.uniaxial(displacement, move=0.2, clamped=True)

# define the constitutive material behavior
umat = fe.NeoHooke(mu=1.0, bulk=2.0)

# newton-rhapson procedure
res = fe.newtonrhapson(displacement, umat=umat, dof1=dof1, dof0=dof0, ext0=ext0)

# save result
fe.save(region, res.x, filename="result.vtk")
```

# Changelog
All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file. The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/), and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

## [2.0.1] - 2022-01-11

### Fixed
- Fixed wrong result of assembly generated by a parallel loop with `prange`.

## [2.0.0] - 2022-01-10

### Added
- Add a new method to deepcopy a `Mesh` with `Mesh.copy()`
- Add [*broadcasting*](https://numpy.org/doc/stable/user/basics.broadcasting.html) capability for trailing axes inside the parallel form integrators.
- Add `Basis` on top of a field for virtual fields used in linear and bilinear forms.
- Add `LinearForm` and `BilinearForm` (including mixed variants) for vector/matrix assembly out of weak form expressions.
- Add `parallel` keyword for threaded integration/assembly of `LinearForm` and `BilinearForm`.

### Changed
- Enhance `Boundary` for the application of prescribed values of any user-defined `Field` which is part of `FieldMixed`.
- The whole mixed-field has to be passed to `dof.apply()` along with the `offsets` returned from `dof.partition` for mixed-field formulations.
- Set default value `shape=(1, 1)` for `hessian()` methods of linear elastic materials.

### Fixed
- Fixed einstein summation of `math.dot()` for two vectors with trailing axes.

### Removed
- Remove `dof.extend` because `dof.partition` does not need it anymore.

## [1.6.0] - 2021-12-02

### Added
- Add `LinearElasticPlaneStress` and `LinearElasticPlaneStrain` material formulations.
- Add `region` argument for `LinearElastic.hessian()`.

### Changed
- Re-formulate `LinearElastic` materials in terms of the deformation gradient.
- Re-formulate `LinearElastic` material in matrix notation (Speed-up of ~10 for elasticity matrix compared to previous implementation.) 
- Move previous `LinearElastic` to `constitution.LinearElasticTensorNotation`.

## [1.5.0] - 2021-11-29

### Added
- Add kwargs of `field.extract()` to `fun` and `jac` of `newtonrhapson`.

### Changed
- Set default number of `threads` in `MatadiMaterial` to `multiprocessing.cpu_count()`.
- Moved documentation to Read the Docs (Sphinx).

### Fixed
- Fix `dim` in calculation of reaction forces (`tools.force`) for `FieldMixed`.
- Fix calculation of reaction moments (`tools.moment`) for `FieldMixed`.

## [1.4.0] - 2021-11-15

### Added
- Add `mask` argument to `Boundary` for the selection of user-defined points.
- Add `shear` loadcase.
- Add a wrapper for `matadi` materials as `MatadiMaterial`.
- Add `verbose` and `timing` arguments to `newtonrhapson`.

### Fixed
- Obtain internal `dim` from Field in calculation of reaction force `tools.force`.
- Fix `math.dot` for combinations of rank 1 (vectors), rank 2 (matrices) and rank 4 tensors.

## [1.3.0] - 2021-11-02

### Changed
- Rename `mesh.as_discontinous()` to `mesh.disconnect()`.
- Rename `constitution.Mixed` to `constitution.ThreeFieldVariation`.
- Rename `unstack` to `offsets` as return of dof-partition and all subsequent references.
- Import tools (`newtonrhapson`, `project`, `save`) and constitution (`NeoHooke`, `LinearElastic` and `ThreeFieldVariation`) to FElupe's namespace.
- Change minimal README-example to a high-level code snippet and refer to docs for details.

## [1.2.0] - 2021-10-31

### Added
- Add template regions, i.e. a region with a `Hexahedron()` element and a quadrature scheme `GaussLegendre(order=1, dim=3)` as `RegionHexahedron`, etc.
- Add biaxial and planar loadcases (like uniaxial).
- Add a minimal README-example (Hello FElupe!).

### Changed
- Deactivate clamped boundary (`clamped=False`) as default option for uniaxial loading `dof.uniaxial`.

## [1.1.0] - 2021-10-30

### Added
- Add inverse quadrature method `quadrature.inv()` for Gauss-Legendre schemes.
- Add discontinous representation of a mesh as mesh method `mesh.as_discontinous()`.
- Add `tools.project()` to project (and average) values at quadrature points to mesh points.

### Changed
- Removed `quadpy` dependency and use built-in polynomials of `numpy` for Gauss-Legendre calculation.

### Fixed
- Fix typo in first shear component of `math.tovoigt()` function.
- Fix wrong stress projection in `tools.topoints()` due to different quadrature and cell ordering.

## [1.0.1] - 2021-10-19

### Changed
- Rename element methods (from `basis` to `function` and from `basisprime` to `gradient`).

- Rename `ndim` to `dim`.
- Simplify element base classes.
- Speed-up calculation of indices (rows, cols) for Fields and Forms (about 10x faster now).

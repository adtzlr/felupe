FElupe is a Python 3.6+ finite element analysis package focussing on the formulation and numerical solution of nonlinear problems in continuum mechanics of solid bodies. Its name is a combination of FE (finite element) and the german word *Lupe* (magnifying glass) as a synonym for getting a little insight how a finite element analysis code looks like under the hood.

# Installation
Install Python, fire up a terminal and run

```shell
pip install felupe[all]
```

where `[all]` installs all optional dependencies. By default, FElupe only depends on `numpy` and `scipy`. In order to make use of all features of FElupe, it is suggested to install all optional dependencies.

# Hello, FElupe!
A quarter model of a solid cube with hyperelastic material behavior is subjected to a uniaxial elongation applied at a clamped end-face. This involves the creation of a mesh, a region and a displacement field. Furthermore, the boundary conditions are created by a template for a uniaxial loadcase. The material behavior is defined through a FElupe-built-in Neo-Hookean material formulation. Inside a Newton-Rhapson procedure, the internal force vector and the tangent stiffness matrix are generated by assembling both linear and bilinear forms of static equilibrium. Finally, the solution of the incremental displacements is calculated und updated until convergence is reached. For more details beside this high-level code snippet, please have a look at the [documentation](https://felupe.readthedocs.io/en/latest/?badge=latest).

```python
import felupe as fe

# create a hexahedron-region on a cube
region = fe.RegionHexahedron(fe.Cube(n=11))

# add a displacement field and apply a uniaxial elongation on the cube
displacement = fe.Field(region, dim=3)
field = fe.FieldContainer([displacement])
boundaries, dof0, dof1, ext0 = fe.dof.uniaxial(field, move=0.2, clamped=True)

# define the constitutive material behavior and create a solid body
umat = fe.NeoHooke(mu=1.0, bulk=2.0)
solid = fe.SolidBody(umat, field)

# newton-rhapson procedure
res = fe.newtonrhapson(bodies=[solid], dof1=dof1, dof0=dof0, ext0=ext0)

# save result
fe.save(region, res.x, filename="result.vtk")
```

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file. The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/), and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

## [4.0.0] - 2022-08-07

- Add `SolidBody.evaluate.kirchhoff_stress()` method. Contrary to the Cauchy stress method, this gives correct results in incompressible plane stress.
- Add `SolidBodyTensor` for tensor-based material definitions with state variables.
- Add `bodies` argument to `newtonrhapson()`.
- Add a container class for fields, `FieldContainer` (renamed from `FieldMixed`).
- Add `len(field)` method for `FieldContainer` (length = number of fields).

### Changed
- Unify handling of `Field` and `FieldMixed`.
- Constitutive models use lists as in- and output (consistency between single- and mixed-formulations).
- Allow field updates directly from 1d sparse-solved vector without splitted by field-offsets.

### Fixed
- Fix `tovoigt()` helper for data with more or less than two trailing axes and 2D tensors.
- Fix errors for `force()` and `moment()` helpers if the residuals are sparse.

### Removed
- Remove wrapper for matADi-materials (not necessary with field containers).
- Remove `IntegralFormMixed` and `IntegralFormAxisymmetric` from global namespace.

## [3.1.0] - 2022-05-02

### Added
- Add optional parallel (threaded) basis evaluation and add `Form(v, u, parallel=True)`.

- Add function to mirror a Mesh `mesh.mirror()`.
- Add a new `parallel` assembly that uses a threaded version of `np.einsum` instead ([einsumt](https://pypi.org/project/einsumt/)).
- Add parallel versions of math helpers (`dya`, `cdya`, `dot`, `ddot`) using [einsumt](https://pypi.org/project/einsumt/).
- Add `parallel` keyword to constitutive models (`NeoHooke`, `LinearElasticTensorNotation` and `ThreeFieldVariation`).
- Add `RegionBoundary` along with template regions for `Quad` and `Hexahedron` and `GaussLegendreBoundary`.

- Add a new Mesh-tool `triangulate()`, applicable on Quad and Hexahedron meshes.
- Add a new Mesh-method `Mesh.as_meshio()`.

### Changed
- Enforce consistent arguments for functions inside `mesh` (`points, cells, cell_data` or `Mesh`).
- Rename Numba-`parallel` assembly to `jit`.
- Move single element shape functions and their derivatives from `region.h` to `region.element.h` and `region.dhdr` to `region.element.dhdr`.
- [Repeat](https://numpy.org/doc/stable/reference/generated/numpy.tile.html) element shape functions and their derivatives for each cell (as preparation for an upcoming `RegionBoundary`).
- Improve `mesh.convert()` by using the function decorator `@mesh_or_data`.
- Allow an array to be passed as the expansion arguments of `mesh.expand()` and `mesh.revolve()`.

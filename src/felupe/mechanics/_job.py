        ----------
        filename : str or None, optional
            The filename of the XDMF result file. Must include the file extension
            ``my_result.xdmf``. If None, no result file is writte during evaluation.
            Default is None.
        mesh : Mesh or None, optional
            A mesh which is used for the XDMF time series writer. If None, it is taken
            from the field of the first item of the first step if no keyword argument
            ``x0`` is given. If None and ``x0=field``, the mesh is taken from the ``x0``

            Additional dict of point-data for the meshio XDMF time series writer.
        cell_data : dict or None, optional
            Additional dict of cell-data for the meshio XDMF time series writer.
        point_data_default : bool, optional
            Flag to write default point-data to the XDMF result file. This includes
            ``"Displacement"``. Default is True.
        cell_data_default : bool, optional
            Flag to write default cell-data to the XDMF result file. This includes
            ``"Principal Values of Logarithmic Strain"``, ``"Logarithmic Strain"`` and
            ``"Deformation Gradient"``. Default is True.
        verbose : bool or int, optional
            Verbosity level to control how messages are printed during evaluation. If
            1 or True and ``tqdm`` is installed, a progress bar is shown. If ``tqdm`` is
            missing or verbose is 2, more detailed text-based messages are printed.
            Default is True.
        parallel : bool, optional
            Flag to use a threaded version of :func:`numpy.einsum` during assembly.
            Requires ``einsumt``. This may add additional overhead to small-sized
            problems. Default is False.
        **kwargs : dict
            Optional keyword arguments for :meth:`~felupe.Step.generate`. If
            ``parallel=True``, it is added as ``kwargs["parallel"] = True`` to the dict

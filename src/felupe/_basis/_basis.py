class Basis:
    r"""A basis and its gradient built on top of a scalar- or vector-valued
    field. *Basis* refers to the trial and test field, either values or
    gradients evaluated at quadrature points. The first two indices of a basis
    are used for looping over the element shape functions ``a`` and its
    components ``i``. The third index represents the vector component ``j`` of
    the field. The two trailing axes ``(q, c)`` contain the evaluated element
    shape functions at quadrature points ``q`` per cell ``c``.

    ..  math::

        \varphi_{aijpc} = \delta_{ij} \left( h_a \right)_{pc}


    For gradients, the fourth index is used for the vector component of the
    partial derivative ``k``.

        \text{grad}(\varphi)_{aijkpc} = \delta_{ij}
            \left( \frac{\partial h_a}{\partial X_K} \right)_{pc}

    Parameters
    ----------
    field : Field
        A field on which the basis should be created.
    parallel : bool, optional (default is False)
        Flag to activate parallel (threaded) basis evaluation.

    Attributes
    ----------
    basis : ndarray
        The evaluated basis functions at quadrature points.
    grad : ndarray
        The evaluated gradient of the basis (if provided by the region).

class DiscreteGeometry:
    """A discrete geometry with points, cells and optional a specified cell type.

    Parameters
    ----------
    points : ndarray
        Point coordinates.
    cells : ndarray
        Point-connectivity of cells.
    cell_type : str or None, optional
        An optional string in VTK-convention that specifies the cell type (default is
        None). Necessary when a discrete geometry is saved to a file.

    Attributes
    ----------
    points : ndarray
        Point coordinates.
    cells : ndarray
        Point-connectivity of cells.
    cell_type : str or None
        A string in VTK-convention that specifies the cell type.
    npoints : int
        Amount of points.
    dim : int
        Dimension of mesh point coordinates.
    ndof : int
        Amount of degrees of freedom.
    ncells : int
        Amount of cells.
    points_with_cells : array
        Array with points connected to cells.
    points_without_cells : array
        Array with points not connected to cells.
    cells_per_point : array
        Array which counts connected cells per point. Used for averaging results.

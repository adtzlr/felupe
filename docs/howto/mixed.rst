Mixed-Field Problems
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

FElupe supports mixed-field formulations in a similar way it can handle (default) single-field formulations. The definition of a mixed-field formulation is shown for the hydrostatic-volumetric selective three-field-variation with independend fields for displacements :math:`\boldsymbol{u}`, pressure :math:`p` and volume ratio :math:`J`. The total potential energy for nearly-incompressible hyperelasticity is formulated with a determinant-modified deformation gradient. The built-in Neo-Hookean material model is used as an argument of :class:`fem.ThreeFieldVariation` for mixed-field problems.

..  code-block:: python

    import felupe as fem

    neohooke = fem.constitution.NeoHooke(mu=1.0, bulk=5000.0)
    umat = fem.constitution.ThreeFieldVariation(neohooke)

Next, let's create a meshed cube for a Hood-Taylor element formulation. The family of Hood-Taylor elements have a pressure field which is one order lower than the displacement field. A Hood-Taylor Q2/P1 hexahedron element formulation is created, where a tri-quadratic continuous (Lagrange) 27-point per cell displacement formulation is used in combination with discontinuous (tetra) 4-point per cell formulations for the pressure and volume ratio fields. The mesh of the cube is converted to a tri-quadratic mesh for the displacement field. The tetra regions for the pressure and the volume ratio are created on a dual (disconnected) mesh for the generation of the discontinuous fields.

..  code-block:: python

    mesh  = fem.Cube(n=5)
    mesh_q2 = mesh.convert(
        order=2,
        calc_points=True,
        calc_midfaces=True,
        calc_midvolumes=True
    )

    region_q2 = fem.RegionTriQuadraticHexahedron(mesh_q2)
    region_p1 = fem.RegionTetra(
        mesh=mesh.dual(points_per_cell=4),
        quadrature=region_q2.quadrature,
        grad=False
    )

    displacement = fem.Field(region_q2,  dim=3)
    pressure     = fem.Field(region_p1, dim=1)
    volumeratio  = fem.Field(region_p1, dim=1, values=1)

    field = fem.FieldContainer(fields=[displacement, pressure, volumeratio])
    solid = fem.SolidBody(umat=umat, field=field)

Boundary conditions are enforced on the displacement field. For the pre-defined loadcases like the clamped uniaxial compression, the boundaries are automatically applied on the first field.

..  code-block:: python

    boundaries, loadcase = fem.dof.uniaxial(field, clamped=True)

The Step and Job definitions are identical to ones used with single field formulations.

..  code-block:: python

    step = fem.Step(
        items=[solid], 
        ramp={boundaries["move"]: fem.math.linsteps([0, -0.4], num=12)},
        boundaries=boundaries
    )
    job = fem.CharacteristicCurve(steps=[step], boundary=boundaries["move"])
    job.evaluate(filename="result.xdmf")

The deformed cube is finally visualized by a XDMF output file with the help of Paraview. The cell-based means of the maximum principal values of the logarithmic strain tensor are shown.

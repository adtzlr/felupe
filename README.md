FElupe is a Python 3.8+ üêç finite element analysis package üì¶ focussing on the formulation and numerical solution of nonlinear problems in continuum mechanics üîß of solid bodies üöÇ. Its name is a combination of FE (finite element) and the german word *Lupe* üîç (magnifying glass) as a synonym for getting an insight üìñ how a finite element analysis code üßÆ looks like under the hood üï≥Ô∏è.

# Installation
Install Python, fire up üî• a terminal and run üèÉ

```shell
pip install --extra-index-url https://wheels.vtk.org felupe[all]
```

where the extra-index-url pulls VTK-wheels if they are not (yet) available on PyPI and `[all]` installs all optional dependencies. FElupe has minimal requirements, all available at PyPI supporting all platforms.
* `numpy` for array operations
* `scipy` for sparse matrices
* `tensortrax` for automatic differentiation

In order to make use of all features of FElupe üíéüí∞üíçüëëüíé, it is suggested to install all optional dependencies.
* `einsumt` for parallel assembly
* `h5py` for XDMF result files
* `matplotlib` for plotting graphs
* `meshio` for mesh-related I/O
* `pyvista` for interactive visualizations
* `tqdm` for showing progress bars during job evaluations

# Getting Started
This tutorial covers the essential high-level parts of creating and solving problems with FElupe. As an introductory example üë®‚Äçüè´, a quarter model of a solid cube with hyperelastic material behaviour is subjected to a uniaxial elongation applied at a clamped end-face. 

First, let‚Äôs import FElupe and create a meshed cube out of hexahedron cells with a given number of points per axis. A numeric region, pre-defined for hexahedrons, is created on the mesh. A vector-valued displacement field is initiated on the region. Next, a field container is created on top of this field. 

A uniaxial load case is applied on the displacement field stored inside the field container. This involves setting up symmetry planes as well as the absolute value of the prescribed displacement at the mesh-points on the right-end face of the cube. The right-end face is *clamped* üõ†Ô∏è: only displacements in direction *x* are allowed. The dict of boundary conditions for this pre-defined load case are returned as `boundaries` and the partitioned degrees of freedom as well as the external displacements are stored within the returned dict `loadcase`. 

An isotropic pseudo-elastic Ogden-Roxburgh Mullins-softening model formulation in combination with an isotropic hyperelastic Neo-Hookean material formulation is applied on the displacement field of a nearly-incompressible solid body. 

A step generates the consecutive substep-movements of a given boundary condition. The step is further added to a list of steps of a job üë©‚Äçüíª (here, a characteristic-curve üìà job is used). During evaluation ‚è≥, each substep of each step is solved by an iterative Newton-Rhapson procedure ‚öñÔ∏è. The solution is exported after each completed substep as a time-series ‚åö XDMF file. Finally, the result of the last completed substep is plotted.

For more details beside this high-level code snippet, please have a look at the üìù [documentation](https://felupe.readthedocs.io/en/latest/?badge=latest).

```python
import felupe as fem

mesh = fem.Cube(n=6)
region = fem.RegionHexahedron(mesh)
field = fem.FieldContainer([fem.Field(region, dim=3)])

boundaries, loadcase = fem.dof.uniaxial(field, clamped=True)

umat = fem.OgdenRoxburgh(material=fem.NeoHooke(mu=1), r=3, m=1, beta=0)
solid = fem.SolidBodyNearlyIncompressible(umat, field, bulk=5000)

move = fem.math.linsteps([0, 1, 0, 1, 2, 1], num=5)
step = fem.Step(items=[solid], ramp={boundaries["move"]: move}, boundaries=boundaries)

job = fem.CharacteristicCurve(steps=[step], boundary=boundaries["move"])
job.evaluate(filename="result.xdmf")
fig, ax = job.plot(
    xlabel="Displacement $u$ in mm $\longrightarrow$",
    ylabel="Normal Force $F$ in N $\longrightarrow$",
)

field.plot("Principal Values of Logarithmic Strain").show()
```
